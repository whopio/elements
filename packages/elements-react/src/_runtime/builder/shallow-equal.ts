 * runtime (referential-stability of injected props) and the react wrapper (guarding DATA-only
 * update()), so the two can't drift on equality semantics. `Object.is` (not `!==`) matters — a
 * NaN-valued prop must compare equal to itself, else the injected cache mints a fresh object every
 * recompute and the element re-renders on every controller render.
